# CSS Utility Classes
CSS Utility classes are a powerful and straightforward way to style elements on a web page. This approach to styling has gained popularity with the rise in popularity of CSS frameworks like [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/).

Utility classes can be a useful tool for minimizing the total number of distinct style definitions on a website, while providing an additional layer of abstraction on top of the design system tokens.

## What are CSS Mixins?
Mixins are a reusable piece of code which can be leveraged throughout a websiteâ€™s CSS. Mixins allow developers to manage code more efficiently and ensure their code is DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) by separating complex style declarations into small manageable functions, and eliminate unnecessary redundancy while maximizing code maintainability.

Having all the often-used patterns in your design system codified helps create a consistent and unified look and feel for the product. For design and development teams it not only helps ensure consistency but also leads to faster development avoid the need for writing custom styles every time.

## Advantage of using CSS Mixins
Below are a list of some benefits to using CSS Mixins.

### Increased code modularity
CSS Mixins allow you to break down complex code into small chunks that can be reused and referenced throughout your project, making development and maintenance easier. 

#### Example
Let's take a simplifed example of a TextField form element that defines specific tokens for `color`, `border-color` and `background-color` for both the `default` and `hover` state.

```css
:root {
    --sds-component-text-field-color-default-foreground-color: #222222;
    --sds-component-text-field-color-default-border-color: #646464;
    --sds-component-text-field-color-default-background-color: #00000000;

    --sds-component-text-field-color-hover-foreground-color: #C6C6C6;
    --sds-component-text-field-color-hover-border-color: #2D7966;
    --sds-component-text-field-color-hover-background-color: #00000000;
}
```

Without mixins the declaration would look like this.

```css
input[type="text"] {
    color: var(--sds-component-text-field-color-default-foreground-color);
	border-color: var(--sds-component-text-field-color-default-border-color);
	background-color: var(--sds-component-text-field-color-default-background-color);

    &:hover {
        color: var(--sds-component-text-field-color-hover-foreground-color);
        border-color: var(--sds-component-text-field-color-hover-border-color);
        background-color: var(--sds-component-text-field-color-hover-background-color);
    }
}
```

Now if we introduce a mixin for the common code we can reduce the number of times we have to redeclare `color`, `border-color` and `background-color`;

```css
/* A text-field mixin that accepts 1 parameter called state used in creating the token */
@define-mixin text-field $state {
	color: var(--sds-component-text-field-color-$(state)-foreground-color);
	border-color: var(--sds-component-text-field-color-$(state)-border-color);
	background-color: var(--sds-component-text-field-color-$(state)-background-color);
}

input[type="text"] {
    @mixin text-field default;

    &:hover {
        @mixin text-field default;
    }
}
```

In reality we have variables that not only map to the `default` and `hover` state but also to the `focus`, `active`, `required` and `disabled` states. With that in mind you can see how modularity in mixins makes development and maintenance easier. 

The implmentation of [buttons](https://github.com/WESCO-International/synergy-dna/blob/main/system/components.css#L1) in Synergy is a great example of how CSS Mixins promote modularity and improve code maintenance.

### Improved code efficiency and readability
CSS Mixins promote uniformity between styles while reducing the amount of code you have to write and eliminating the need to memorize token names.

#### Example
Let say we have a design for a card that requires large padding around it.

In pure CSS we would require the name of the large padding token to do this.

```css 
.card {
    padding: var(--sds-semantic-spacing-around-component-lg);
}
```

Alternativly, you could use the padding mixin and achive the same result without having to remember the token name.

```css 
.card {
    @mixin padding lg;
}
```

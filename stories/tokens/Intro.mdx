# Introduction to Design Tokens

## What are Design Tokens?

Design tokens are all the values needed to construct and maintain a design system — spacing, color, typography, object styles, animation, etc. — represented as data. These can represent anything defined by design: a color as a RGB value, an opacity as a number, an animation ease as Bezier coordinates. They’re used in place of hard-coded values in order to ensure flexibility and unity across all product experiences.

## Why use Design Tokens?

Using design tokens Wesco can guarantee consistency, improve maintainability, and enable designers to rapidly develop and deploy solutions without conflicts created by highly-specific hard-coded values. Additionally, tokens allow us to build and reuse components in our designs more quickly and reliably, making changes easier for designers to manage over time. 

With the help of design tokens, designers & developers can quickly scale and design templates and components faster, allowing them to keep pace with rapidly evolving customer expectations.

## Design token format

The design tokens in the Synergy Design System all follow a similar naming pattern.

`--{namespace}-{component | category}-{property}-{attribute}-(state optional)`
